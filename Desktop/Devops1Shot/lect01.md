# What is Devops ?
It is a culture that improves delivery

let say     ->  example.com --->10 days(v1->v2) 

but it should be within hours/ 1-2 days then it should be occur in couple of days this is called devops

but it 's only abptu delivery no devops is about imrpoving delivery + Automation
it's also about monitoring  but how would ensure the quality is maintained after that another improtant aspect is testing 

Note: Devops is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring         (Basics)
        | -> Atuomation is maintained 
        | -> Code quality is maintaineed
        | -> Continuous monitoring 
        | -> Continuous Testing
By acheivig all of this our end goal is there should be no manual thing and reduce the timing of deployemnt bu ensuring all the above
