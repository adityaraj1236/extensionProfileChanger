# Day-02 
# Software Developement LifeCycle (SDLC)
It is a process used buyt the software idnustry to design develop and test
Design 
Develop
Test
But what us the end goal of SDLC 
To deliver a high quality

Let say we are working in exammple.com  we deliver  an ecommerce application


1st phase --> Planning<----------|  (Software Requirement SPecificarion Document)-> collect all documentationa&data  
2nd phase --> Defining           |  
3rd phase --> Designing          |  (Desiging phase HLD  for scalaility) for LLD the senior memeber will mention to use=                                                                                       use  any fucntion call and all
4th phase --> Building           |-----|
5th phase --> Testing            |     |---->Focus of interest for Devops engineer
6th phase --> Deployment --------|-----|     

If they want to support a new feature 
as they are ecommerce or merchant website now orgainsation has decided to launch a kid's catalogue you have to given 
they get the input from the customers



Building ---> Developing by reading JIRA Documentation like designing and pushg to git 

++Testing ---> Testing phase  applicain stored in git repo is taken and deployed on server and then QE team quality asurance engineer 


++Deployement ----> in deployement phase promote this applicaion to production (Receiver one Customer)


Now all these things on joint is known as devops basically here fastens this process improves to deliveirng the code fastering

Fasten ----> Quickly -------> Automated 
(Building + Testing + Deployment + Automation)


# Note : All thsi can be done in different ways which we will discuss in project management  (one method is Agile method  where firs tchunk is done thendo it now as of now)
